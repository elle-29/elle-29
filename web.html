        Lyrics
    </h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        You'll be safe in my romance, babe <br>
        Label's fading <br>
        But I see you cravin' for more <br>
        You're denying it <br>
        But you ain't controlling your actions <br>
        Keep me guessing <br>
        But don't keep me waiting for us <br>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        Oh, I live to appreciate you <br>
        Take all the love that I give <br>
        All that I wish is for you to take me <br>
        But I taste the lies on your lips <br>
        I count the days when we're in love <br>
        'Cause I only matter when he's not around <br>
        Oh, but I live to appreciate you <br>
        Take all the love that I give <br>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        Got my heart on my sleeve <br>
        I'm beggin' the heavens to be good to me <br>
        Are you obsessive, love? <br>
        'Cause I'm tolerating all of your desires <br>
        I'll keep you wanting me more, ooh <br>
        Leave, but I'll keep you comin' <br>
        I'm sure it's my love that got you suffocated <br>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        Oh, I live to appreciate you <br>
        Take all the love that I give <br>
        All that I wish is for you to take me <br>
        But I taste the lies on your lips <br>
        I count the days when we're in love <br>
        'Cause I only matter when he's not around <br>
        Oh, but I live to appreciate you <br>
        Take all the love that I given <br>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        Take all the love that I give <br>
        All that I- <br>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        You come over but not too often <br>
        You don't visit 'cause you got more options <br>
        You come over but not too often <br>
        You don't visit 'cause you got more options <br>
